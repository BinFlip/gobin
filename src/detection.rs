//! Go binary detection via heuristic string matching.
//!
//! This module provides the lowest-confidence detection layer. When a binary's format
//! cannot be parsed (corrupted headers, unknown format) and no structural markers are
//! found (no pclntab magic, no build ID), we fall back to scanning for strings that
//! appear in virtually every Go binary.
//!
//! ## Why These Strings Survive
//!
//! The Go runtime references these function names and error messages at runtime for
//! stack traces, panic output, and goroutine management. Even heavily stripped or
//! obfuscated Go binaries retain them in the pclntab's `funcnametab` (which is
//! separate from the ELF/PE symbol table).
//!
//! ## Confidence Levels
//!
//! The [`Confidence`] enum represents how certain we are that a binary is Go-compiled:
//!
//! | Level    | Meaning                                                     |
//! |----------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | `None`   | No Go indicators found                                      |
//! | `Low`    | Heuristic string matches only (could be false positive)     |
//! | `Medium` | Build info or version string found                          |
//! | `High`   | Structural proof: pclntab magic, section names, or build ID |

///
/// Consumers persist this enum into long-lived schemas (database columns,

/// - **Variants** — append-only. New tiers appear as new variants; existing
///   variants are never renamed or removed.
/// - **`Display` strings** (and [`Self::as_str`]) — fixed forever once
///   shipped. Treat them as serialization keys.
/// - **`Debug` strings** — *not* a stability surface. Use `Display` /
///   `as_str` for anything that lands in a database column.
